Notes for VS Code setup of Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20&list=PLdtk3tNgu15Q4sdZK0VeNPsLJyoQPpaOr&index=2

I'm using the Python interpreter in this directory: C:\Users\JK696X\Documents\joekfolder\pythondevelopment\testproject\venv\Scripts\python.exe

To run the virtual enviornment, you need administrator privalages, so open VS Code as Administrator

To create virtual environment(Standard virtual environment):
1. cd into the folder of your project
2. in the command line, type: python -m venv venv
3. In VS Code, select the virtual environment selected in your project.
4. It would be a good idea to install stuff you need on your virtual enviornment. FOr example: 
pip install pylint
5. Make sure VS Code is using your virtual environment in the bottom left hand corner


To format your code in VS Code, you can type SHIFT + ALT + F

For running the 'black' interpreter, first install it with 'pip install black'
In VS Code, you can set it as your default linter doing the following:

After getting a linter installed, you can use the format keyshortcut above to make your python file pretty

You need to install the pylinter on the virtual environment as well. You can run the following for pylint:
pip install pylint

You can install code runner for keeping track of various Python vairable settings. YOu should see that 'Run' button
in the top right of the editor
Make sure you set it to use your personal environemnt in settings!(See video)
(You can also look at the code runner documentation)

To comment out sections of Python code in VS Studio, use CTRL + K + C to comment
or use CTRL + SHIFT + K to uncomment

To get modules from files in other directories:
