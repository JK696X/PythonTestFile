Notes for VS Code setup of Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20&list=PLdtk3tNgu15Q4sdZK0VeNPsLJyoQPpaOr&index=2

I'm using the Python interpreter in this directory: C:\Users\JK696X\Documents\joekfolder\pythondevelopment\testproject\venv\Scripts\python.exe

To run the virtual enviornment, you need administrator privalages, so open VS Code as Administrator

To format your code in VS Code, you can type SHIFT + ALT + F

For running the 'black' interpreter, first install it with 'pip install black'
In VS Code, you can set it as your default linter doing the following:

After getting a linter installed, you can use the format keyshortcut above to make your python file pretty

You need to install the pylinter on the virtual environment as well. You can run the following for pylint:
pip install pylint
