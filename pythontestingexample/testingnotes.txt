nose2 is a package that's good for testing MULTIPLE lines of tests
To install: pip install nose2

Methods need to be written with test_ for this to work

Before testing, make sure you 'cd' into the testing directory, (in this case 'pythontestingexample', then 'testing')
run the following:
python -m unittest test_calc.py
if you have that main addtiona at the bottom it runs ALL tests. You can run it all with this:
python test_calc.py

For the output results, dots mean the test cases passed. An F indicates a failure.

Make sure that if there's a test case you didn't add to your testing,(after it broke your program),
you'll always want to add that later!

Use 'setup' and 'teardown' methods to keep order of your 100s of tests

@classmethod means we're working with the class rather than the INSTANCE of the class

setup and teardown classes are used for very system intensive test actions you want to perform.
For example, setting up a DB connection, then tearing it down.
