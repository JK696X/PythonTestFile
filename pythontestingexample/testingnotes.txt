nose2 is a package that's good for testing MULTIPLE lines of tests
To install: pip install nose2

Methods need to be written with test_ for this to work

Before testing, make sure you 'cd' into the testing directory, (in this case 'pythontestingexample', then 'testing')
run the following:
python -m unittest test_calc.py
if you have that main addtiona at the bottom it runs ALL tests. You can run it all with this:
python test_calc.py

For the output results, dots mean the test cases passed. An F indicates a failure.

Make sure that if there's a test case you didn't add to your testing,(after it broke your program),
you'll always want to add that later!
